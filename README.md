SQL Data Warehousing and Analytics Solution (Medallion Architecture)
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, designed to follow best industry practices for data management, transformation, and visualization. It demonstrates how ERP and CRM data can be ingested, processed, and structured into a scalable SQL-based data warehouse, following the Medallion Architecture. The end goal is to provide high-quality, analytics-ready data that can drive business insights via Power BI dashboards.

Data Sources
The project ingests ERP and CRM data in CSV format. These files contain transactional records, customer interactions, sales data, financial transactions, and operational metrics. These structured data sources are crucial for business intelligence (BI), reporting, and predictive analytics.

Data Pipeline (ETL Process)
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is built using MySQL as the core data processing engine. The three-layered Medallion Architecture ensures data quality, consistency, and security at every stage:

1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data Storage)
-> Ingests CSV files into MySQL without modification.
-> Acts as a raw data lake, storing historical records for future audits.
-> Handles schema evolution, ensuring flexibility for future changes.

3. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Processed Data)
-> Cleanses, deduplicates, and standardizes data using SQL transformations.
-> Performs data type normalization, ensuring consistent formats.
-> Implements data integrity checks, removing null values and fixing incorrect entries.
-> Joins ERP and CRM data where necessary for business-wide analysis.

4. Gold Layer (Business Intelligence & Analytics-Ready Data)
Aggregates key business metrics such as revenue trends, customer churn rates, and operational efficiency indicators.
Optimized for fast query performance using indexing and partitioning.
Creates fact and dimension tables following the Star Schema to support Power BI reporting.
Provides a single source of truth (SSOT) for data analysts and stakeholders.

Data Warehouse Implementation
-> The SQL data warehouse is built on MySQL, structured using OLAP-friendly techniques.
-> Fact Tables store transactional data (e.g., sales, customer interactions).
-> Dimension Tables store descriptive data (e.g., customer details, product categories).
-> Implements partitioning and indexing to enhance query performance.

Business Intelligence & Reporting (Power BI)
-> The Gold Layer is directly connected to Power BI, enabling real-time dashboards.
Reports include:
-> Customer Segmentation Analysis (from CRM data).
-> Sales Performance & Revenue Forecasting (from ERP data).
-> Operational Efficiency Metrics (aggregated from both sources).
-> Supports interactive visualizations and drill-down analysis for stakeholders.

Security & Governance (SOC 2 Compliance)
-> Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access.
-> Data encryption ensures secure storage and transmission.
-> Audit logs and monitoring provide traceability for all data transformations.
-> Data retention policies align with SOC 2 compliance to ensure security and privacy.

Future Enhancements: Machine Learning Integration
Plans to integrate ML models into the data pipeline.
-> Use Case 1: Customer Churn Prediction (analyzing CRM interactions to predict customer attrition).
-> Use Case 2: Sales Forecasting (using historical ERP data for predictive analytics).
-> Use Case 3: Anomaly Detection (identifying fraud or operational inefficiencies).
-> ML models will be trained using Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) and integrated via APIs or stored procedures.

Conclusion
This project serves as a portfolio demonstration of industry-grade data warehousing and analytics best practices. By leveraging the Medallion Architecture, it ensures scalability, performance, and high data quality. The Power BI integration transforms the SQL data warehouse into a decision-making powerhouse, and planned ML integration will further enhance predictive analytics capabilities.
